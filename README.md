# GoSquared API - PHP Client

A simple Object Oriented wrapper for GoSquared API, written with PHP.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 5.3.3 with [cURL](http://php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php) extension,
* [Buzz](https://github.com/kriswallsmith/Buzz) library,

## Autoload

The new version of `gosquared-api` using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).
The first step to use `gosquared-api` is to download composer:

```bash
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Then we have to install our dependencies using:
```bash
$ php composer.phar install
```
Now we can use autoloader from Composer by:

```yaml
{
    "require": {
        "stloyd/gosquared-api": "*@dev"
    }
}
```

> `gosquared-api` follows the PSR-0 convention names for its classes, which means you can easily integrate `gosquared-api` classes loading in your own autoloader.

## Basic usage of `gosquared-api` client

```php
<?php

// This file is generated by Composer
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';

$client = new GoSquared\Client();

echo $client->api('time')->show();
```
